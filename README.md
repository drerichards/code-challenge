*Goal is to complete the app in about 5 - 10 hours.*

Realistically though it'll probably take about 10 to 20 since I'm unfamiliar with their API and how I should present it on the front end.

*Going to try to tackle the most accessible endpoints available*

This seems to be **CATEGORIES** and then **RESTAURANTS**. Based on the API documentation. Things like **Reviews & Photos** require partner access and I don't have much time for that. I'll have to assume that the user is in a given location so that I don't have to access every city. Though that could potentially be done on another iteration.

*Then I'll get information and order it in the most accessible way*

*Once that's done I can work on presenting it in a more aesthethically pleasing way.*

Should look like below
