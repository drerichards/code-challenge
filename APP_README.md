Time spent: Less than 2 Hours, Didn't use Create React App - I scaffolded from scratch. I wanted to have tests, a better UI (semantic-ui), be more fleshed out 
The biggest feature is the inclusion of aysnc/await to handle the Zomato API
Preformance Tracking: Currently doing with Zulip - using react-addons-perf and Travis CI
